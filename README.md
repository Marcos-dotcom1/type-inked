# Type Inked 🎨🖋️

Welcome to **Type Inked** — the classiest, most unapologetically cool vintage typing effect generator you didn’t know you needed, but now you’ll pretend you always wanted.

## 📖 What’s this thing?

A website that slaps a typewriter effect onto your text like it’s 1965 and you’re Ernest Hemingway on a deadline. No complicated setups, no bloated features, no unnecessary clutter. Just type your stuff, hit the button, and watch it type itself out like it means business.

## 🎨 Features

* **Vintage Typewriter Effect:** Your text, typed out letter by letter. Smooth. Old-school.
* **Theme Toggle:** Dark mode because obviously, and a clean mode if you're feeling wholesome. No neon yellows assaulting your retinas. Also; Comic.
* **Customizable Text Input:** Write whatever you want. Go wild. Quote Nietzsche, write passive-aggressive breakup messages, or just type “beans” on repeat.
* **Fast as Hell:** Loads quick. No waiting. Life’s too short.

## ✨ Why Does This Exist?

Because most text animation tools are either boring, ugly, or made by someone who thinks Comic Sans is a personality trait. I wanted something clean, simple, and a little moody. So I built it.

Now it exists. And it’s glorious.
